title: Throwback Thursday 10 - Lunar Ruins

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Lunar Ruins by Tomonn, which released April 24th, 2020. Lunar Ruins is one of the most influential maps to ever come out! Of course it inspired the map Darkmoon Ruins, but it continues to inspire maps made today with it's innovative and exciting difficult gameplay. Don't take my word for it, play through the 3 chapter campaign now with the link below!
