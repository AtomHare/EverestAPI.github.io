The first ever Celeste Modded Tier 0 Golden has been achieved! After almost 700 hours of playing and about a year of attempts, on January 27th, Clantis obtained the full clear golden of Waterbear Mountain by FrenchTardigrade. This may be one of the hardest gaming achievements in general. Go show Clantis some love and like and subscribe to their youtube channel, which the video of the clear is linked below.
