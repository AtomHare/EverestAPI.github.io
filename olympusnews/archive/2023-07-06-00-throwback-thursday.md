Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Oshiro's Fun Ride by SunsetQuasar, which released November 26th, 2020. Can you believe this map is almost 3 years old? Return to the Celestial Resort and run from Oshiro one more time in this tricky map! Try playing one of SunsetQuasar's newer maps after this one to see 3 years worth of improvement!
