If you're on Windows and if Olympus keeps prompting you to update, please open Task Manager and force-close Olympus main.exe

If you're on Windows and if Olympus keeps prompting you to update,  
please open Task Manager and force-close Olympus main.exe  

There is a bug with luacom.dll which keeps main.exe hanging in the background.  
The update won't get applied until main.exe is closed.  

After fully closing Olympus, restart it and it should be on the latest version.  

Newer versions of Olympus no longer use luacom.dll and thus aren't affected by this bug.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
