title: Throwback Thursday 11 - October

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features October by Nyan and Ru, which released November 12th, 2021. My girlfriend picked the map this week, so you guys can't get mad I choose a map I made! But this map is pretty cool (no bias here)! Traverse through a spooky landscape of intermediate gameplay with a devious grandmaster secret at the end! Play it now with the link below!
