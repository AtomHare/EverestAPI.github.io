Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features The Blizzard by IsaGoodFriend, which released April 11th, 2021. This map takes the infamous demo dash and tries to make it a little less spooky. Dash through the chilling cold whether it’s in the A, B, or C-Side and grab all the collectibles you can!

If you’d like to suggest a map for the next issue, message ppnyan on discord with any recommendations!
