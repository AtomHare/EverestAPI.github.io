title: Throwback Thursday 07 - Bounce Helper Gym

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Tech Compendium: Bounce Helper Gym by Flamecrafter113, which released December 20th, 2021. This map is a great introduction to the Bounce Helper Mod’s moveset. You learn tons of tips and tricks, as well as general concepts, to bounce to the top of any map! Not only is it a great tutorial, its also very fun!
