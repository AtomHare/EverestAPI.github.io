title: Throwback Thursday 08 - Shattered Skies

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Shattered Skies by ABuffZucchini, Juno, coffe789, Gamation, mmm and neozoid, which released July 25th, 2021. That’s a lot of people that worked on this map! That’s because this map was similar to a game of telephone, where the map was passed along to see what would come out. It’s super fun and features amazing music by neozoid!
