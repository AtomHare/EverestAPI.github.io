Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Foe-En Monolith by MunTheory, which was released February 12th, 2021. The map was originally a teaser to the now canceled map Life on the Moon. With exciting visuals, tricky moves, and kevins galore, intermediate players are up for a great challenge in this map!
