title: 'Olympus Update Bug'
ignore: false

---

If you're on Windows and if Olympus keeps prompting you to update, please open Task Manager and force-close all Olympus main.exe processes.  

There is a bug with luacom.dll which keeps main.exe hanging in the background. This means that the updater never finishes successfully.  

After doing so, restart Olympus and it should be on the latest version.  

Newer versions of Olympus no longer use luacom.dll and thus aren't affected by this bug.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
