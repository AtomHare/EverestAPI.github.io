Hey everyone, we're going to be having a Q&A stream at Saturday (May 1st), 6 PM GMT!  
This stream will be public, meaning both people inside and outside of the Strawberry Jam  
Collab can have their questions answered there; this stream is mainly targeted towards  
the Celeste community as a whole for answering questions. Tell anyone you know will be interested!  


We're going to be collecting questions on a special website.  
With this, people can type questions during the week before the stream happens, so that  
when the stream happens we can give answers to all of them, plus questions asked alive.  

The stream will be hosted on the CelesteCommunity Twitch channel.  

The following people will be on the stream to answer questions:  
Playtesting Captains: Bigkahuna & Theta  
Mapping Captains: Bissy, Frozenflygone & Rocketguy2, Aiden, RDoggo8, Hydro  
Art Captains: Maildropfolder & nerferd  
Coding Captain: max480 (In chat)  
Decoration Captain: Linj  
Music Captain: BeanJammin
