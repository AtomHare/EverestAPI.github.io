If you're playing with the Celeste beta, not all mods will work out of the box.  
Everest works perfectly fine with Celeste 1.3.1.2 (non-beta and OpenGL beta).  
Everest 2421 works well with Celeste 1.3.3.14 but needs testing and some mods might need fixes.  
Mod button rebinding menus are missing and there's one visual glitch in the new vanilla rebinding menu.  
Please report all your problems in #modding_help! That's what betas are for after all :)
