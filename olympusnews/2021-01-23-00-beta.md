Some mods might not work with Celeste 1.3.3.14+  

Everest works perfectly fine with Celeste 1.3.1.2 (non-beta and OpenGL beta).  

Everest betas usually work with Celeste betas but need testing and some mods might crash.  

Please report all your problems in #modding_help! That's what betas are for after all :)
