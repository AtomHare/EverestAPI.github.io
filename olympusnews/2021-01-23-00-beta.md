If you're playing with the Celeste beta, not all mods will work out of the box.  
Celeste 1.3.1.2 (non-beta and OpenGL beta) works perfectly fine.  
Everest 1721 works well with Celeste 1.3.3.14 but needs testing and some mods might need fixes.  
Mod button rebinding menus are missing and there's one visual glitch in the new vanilla rebinding menu.  
Please report all your problems on the Celestecord! That's what betas are for after all.
