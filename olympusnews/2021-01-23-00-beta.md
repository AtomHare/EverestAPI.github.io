Everest works perfectly fine with Celeste 1.3.1.2 (non-beta and OpenGL beta).  

Celeste 1.4.0.0 just got released.  
Use Everest 2741 (beta) or newer.  

Everest itself works fine, but some mods might not work.  
Please report all your problems in #modding_help! That's what betas are for after all :)
