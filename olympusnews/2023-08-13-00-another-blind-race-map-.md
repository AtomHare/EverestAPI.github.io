Created by pink_iceCream, ABuffZucchini, and Star_Sapphire for the Fangame Summer Feast, Purple Shadow features over a dozen rooms of expert to grandmaster gameplay, presenting itself as some of the most smooth and intuitive routing to date, accompanied by visually striking deco, and a multitude of mechanics. Not featured in the stream are some extra-hard bonus rooms, for any hard-core Celeste players up to the challenge! Download and have fun with the link below!
